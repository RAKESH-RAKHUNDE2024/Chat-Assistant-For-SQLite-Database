    "<!-- Step 2: Develop the Chat Assistant in Python\n",
    "Now, you can build the chat assistant using Python. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the components needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python Libraries:\n",
    "SQLite3 (for database interaction).\n",
    "Flask or FastAPI (for serving the chat assistant as a web app).\n",
    "NLTK or spaCy (optional, for natural language processing to convert queries into SQL).\n",
    "SQLAlchemy (optional, if you prefer working with ORM instead of raw SQL queries).\n",
    "2. Chat Assistant Logic:\n",
    "You will need to parse the user query to convert it into SQL queries and return appropriate responses. Here's an example of how you can approach it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Handle Queries\n",
    "You need to design functions to handle the specific types of queries mentioned in the assignment. Here's how you might structure these:\n",
    "\n",
    "Query 1: \"Show me all employees in the [department] department.\"\n",
    "You can extract the department name from the query and form an SQL query: -->"
