## Project Summary:-

This Project Is A Python-Based Chat Assistant That Interacts With An SQLite Database To Respond To Natural Language Queries. The Assistant Is Capable Of Processing User Queries Related To Employees And Departments Within An Organization, Converting These Queries Into SQL Commands, Retrieving The Relevant Data, And Returning Clear And Formatted Responses. The Project Leverages The Flask Web Framework For Building The Api And SQLite For Data Storage. 

The Assistant Supports A Variety Of Queries, Including Retrieving Employee Information, Identifying Department Managers, Listing Employees Based On Hire Date, And Calculating Salary Expenses For Departments. Additionally, The Solution Incorporates Error Handling Mechanisms To Manage Invalid Queries, Missing Data, And Incorrect Formats, Providing A Seamless User Experience.
